In theoretical physics, fine-tuning is the process in which parameters of a model must be adjusted very precisely in order to fit with certain observations.
The number of hidden neurons should be between the size of the input layer and the size of the output layer. The number of hidden neurons should be 2/3 the size of the input layer, plus the size of the output layer. The number of hidden neurons should be less than twice the size of the input layer.
The number of layers in a neural network defines its depth.
Also, a neural network must have at least two layers: Input layer – it brings the input data into the system and represents the beginning of the neural network architecture.
The number of hidden neurons should be between the size of the input layer and the size of the output layer. The number of hidden neurons should be 2/3 the size of the input layer, plus the size of the output layer. The number of hidden neurons should be less than twice the size of the input layer.
Image result for d. Form of activation
A customer activation form is used by companies that offer products or services to sign up new customers. A customer activation form is often used by financial institutions to collect information from new customers and create new accounts.
Optimization is one of the core components of machine learning. The essence of most machine learning algorithms is to build an optimization model and learn the parameters in the objective function from the given data.
The linear schedule decreases the learning rate by the same amount (decrement) every epoch. Depending on the Decrement per epoch, the learning rate can reach zero quite fast, so set the value depending on the Learning rate. Figure 2. Linear decay with Learning rate=0.01 and Decrement per epoch=0.002.
Mini-batch sizes, commonly called “batch sizes” for brevity, are often tuned to an aspect of the computational architecture on which the implementation is being executed. Such as a power of two that fits the memory requirements of the GPU or CPU hardware like 32, 64, 128, 256, and so on.

Regularization is a better technique than Reducing the number of features to overcome the overfitting problem as in Regularization we do not discard the features of the model. Regularization is a technique that penalizes the coefficient. In an overfit model, the coefficients are generally inflated.
Advertisements. It may be defined as the normalization technique that modifies the dataset values in a way that in each row the sum of the squares will always be up to 1. It is also called least squares.
The Dropout layer randomly sets input units to 0 with a frequency of rate at each step during training time, which helps prevent overfitting. Inputs not set to 0 are scaled up by 1/(1 - rate) such that the sum over all inputs is unchanged
Data augmentation is the process of modifying, or “augmenting” a dataset with additional data. This additional data can be anything from images to text, and its use in machine learning algorithms helps improve their performance.
Data augmentation is one of the critical elements of Deep Learning projects. It proves its usefulness in combating overfitting and making models generalize better. Besides the regularization feature, transformations can artificially enlarge the dataset by adding slightly modified copies of already existing images.
Data augmentation in data analysis are techniques used to increase the amount of data by adding slightly modified copies of already existing data or newly created synthetic data from existing data. It acts as a regularizer and helps reduce overfitting when training a machine learning model.
